  2. **Landing Page** (Specific to the product)  
      - it should be specific landing page which talk about a particular product  
        - e.g. site for creating free landing page [https://www.mailmunch.com/](https://www.mailmunch.com/)  
          - signup on site and it will provide you template to create landing page
