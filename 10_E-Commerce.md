## E-Commerce Website Creation  

- Create your E-Commerce website using installation of wordpress on your domain/sub-domain available in SiteGround [https://www.siteground.com/](https://www.siteground.com/) hosting  
- For enabling e-Commerce features on you website, you can use plug-in **WooCommerce**  
- After WooCommerce plug-in installtion, you can create products, description, image uploads in gallery etc... similar to other e-commerce websites..  

## After creating e-commerce website, now you need to set-up Paid Ads run so that people can visit your site and buy products  
  - Facebook Ads are less expensive than Google Ads  
  - Now lets create Facebook Ads:  
    - Go to the Facebook Ad Manager and create Ads for E-commerce product [Basic fundamental for these facebook Ads are different than facebook Ads for websites because its product marketing (not the website promoting) so here first you need to create **Product Catalog**)]
    - For creating Product Catalog ==> Go to the Ad Manager ==> Asset ==> select **Catalogs**  
    - click on **Create Catalog** and select **E-commerce**
    - click on **Upload Product Info** and provide name of Product Catalog  
    - Now add producs under manage --> product  
    - select **Add Manually** and provide required information of product  
    - In case, if you have 1000 of products to add in catalog then you can also choose **Use Data Feeds**. Here Facebook will provide you excel-template where you can provide product information which can be upload at once in system..  
    - After creating product catalog, again go to the Facebook Ad manager and select **Audience** section from **Ad Set**  
    - From **Audience** section, create new Audience either **Retarget products to people who visited your website** OR **target customers if they haven't visited your website** i.e. new customers  
    - Remember to select **Engaged Shoppers** from **Detailed Targeting** (for Behaviors > Purchase behavior) so that your Ad visible to those people who generally do shopping othwise it will be display un-necessary for those who don't do shopping..  
    - Also from **Budget & Schedule**, select **Conversion Event** for Optimization for Ad Delivery. And the **Event Type** should be **Purchase**  
    - **Conversion Window** can be **7 Days click**  
    - click on continue for next step  
    - Format of Ad, you can select **Carousel** 
    - **Call-to-Action** --> Show Now  
    - click on **Confirm**  
    - **NOTE:** For shopping site, your site should run over HTTPS otherwise facebook will reject your Ads becuase this will require payment over secure medium.
